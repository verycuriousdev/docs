title: Errors & Recovery
description: Auth guards, token expiry, credits, WS reconnect, and drift.

- Auth guard → prompt connect
- Token expiry → refresh; on failure → logout
- Low credits → CTA to /subscribe
- WS reconnect with backoff; resubscribe to topics
- Backend drift: tolerate outputs array/object; fallback to result.url.
