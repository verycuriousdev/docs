description: Inputs, constraints, alignment, and mitigations.

## Inputs

- Video URL/job; brief: genre/tempo/mood; references
- Constraints: duration; loudness; stems

## Alignment

- Beats on cuts; swells on reveals; cadence on last frame

## Failure modes

- Mood mismatch → refine brief + tempo
- Clipping → reduce loudness; add limiter.
